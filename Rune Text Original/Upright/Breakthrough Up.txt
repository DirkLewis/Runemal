Here is the final Rune belonging to the Cycle of Self-Transformation.  Drawing it marks a major shift or breakthrough in the process of self-change, a complete transformation in attitude - a 180-degree turn.  For some, the transition is so radical that they no longer continue to live the ordinary life in the ordinary way.

Because the timing is right, the outcome is assured although not, from the present vantage point, predictable.  Rely, therefore, on radical trust, even through the moment may call for you to leap, empty handed into the Void.  Confront and vanquish your refusal to let right action flow through you.  In each life there comes at least one moment which, if recognized and seized, transforms the course of that live forever.

If Dagaz is followed by the Blank Rune, the magnitude of the transformation might be so total as portend a death, the successful conclusion of your passage.

A major period of achievement and prosperity is sometimes introduced by this Rune.  The darkness is behind you; daylight has come.  However, as always, you are put on notice to be mindful not to collapse yourself into the future or to behave recklessly in you new situation.  A lot of hard work can be involved in a time of transformation.  Undertake to do it joyfully.
