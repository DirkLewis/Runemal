Unseen powers are active here, creative and fertile powers of Nature.  The attributes of Laguz are water, fluidity, the ebb and flow of tides and emotions, careers and relationships.  It fulfills our need to immerse ourselves in the experience of living without having to evaluate or understand, it speaks to the desire for comfort and the satisfaction of emotional needs, the lunar side of our nature.  For while the sun strives for differentiation, the moon draws us toward unity and merging.

This Rune often signals a time for cleansing: for revaluing, reorganizing, realigning.  A Rune of knowing and psychic power, it may call you to study spiritual matters in readiness for deep self-transformation.  For a man, success now lies in contacting his intuitive knowing; for a woman, in attuning to her own rhythms.  A Rune of the self relating rightly to the Self, it signifies what alchemists called the conjunctio, or sacred marriage.  In fairy tales, it is the end where the hero and heroine live happily ever after.
