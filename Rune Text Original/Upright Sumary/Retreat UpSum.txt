Real property is associated with this Rune, for Othila is the Rune of acquisition and benefits.  It seems strange to say, but the benefits you receive, the "inheritance," may be derived from something you must give up.  This can be particularly difficult when that which you are called upon to give up or abandon is part of your background, you cultural inheritance.
