Sowelu marks a time for recharging and regeneration right down to the cellular level.  You may actually experience power surges, for the energies involved can be drastic.  Although this Rune has no Reversed position, there is reason for caution.  You may even see fit to withdraw, to retreat in the face of a pressing situation, especially if events or people are demanding that you "spend" your energy now.
