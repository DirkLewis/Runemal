Upright or Reversed, this is a difficult Rune.  The necessity of relating to severe constraint is its lesson.  Its positive aspects represent the limitations we directly cause ourselves; its negative side attracts limitations from people around us.  Try not to take this world personally, this Rune is saying, work with the shadow, examine what  inside you magnetizes misfortune into your life.
