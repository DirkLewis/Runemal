Perth signifies an intense aspect of initiation.  Nothing external matters here, except as it shows you its inner reflection.  this Rune is concerned with the deepest stratum of being, with the bedrock on which your fate is founded.  For some, Perth means experiencing a psychic death.  If need be, let go of everything, no exceptions, no exclusions.  Nothing less than renewal of the Spirit is at stake.
