This is not a time or situation in which you can make your influence felt.  Patience is the counsel Eihwaz offers.  Nothing hectic, no acting needy or lusting after a desired outcome.  This Rune speaks to the difficulties that arise at the beginning of new life.  Often it announces a time of waiting: for a spring to fill up with water, for fruit to ripen on the bough.
