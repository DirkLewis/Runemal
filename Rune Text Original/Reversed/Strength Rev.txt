Without ears to hear and eyes to see, you may fail to take advantage of the moment.  The negative result could well be an opportunity missed, a weakening of your position.  It may seem that your won strength is being used against you.

For some, this Rune Reversed will serve to alert, providing clues in the form of minor failures and disappointments.  For others, those more deeply unconscious or unaware, it should provide a hard jolt.  Reversed, it calls for some serious thoughts about the quality of your relationship to your Self.

But take heart.  Remember the constant cycling of death and rebirth, the endless going and return.  Everything we experience has a beginning, a middle, and end, and is followed by a new beginning.  Therefor do not draw back from the passage into darkness.  When in deep water, become a diver.
