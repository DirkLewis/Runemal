Events or, more likely, aspects of character, interfere with growth of new life and life process.  You may feel dismay at failing to take right action.  But rather than dismay, what is called for here is diligence.  Examine what has taken place, your role in it, your needs, the needs of others.  Are you placing your wants before the need of others?  Strip down until you can identify the blocks to growth in this situation.  Then, penetrating gently, imitate the wind.

You may be required to fertilize the ground again; but through correct preparation, growth is assured.
