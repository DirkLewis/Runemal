The warning is that you take pains not to be mechanical or unaware.  This is not a time to be bound by old conditioning, old authority.  Ask yourself what feels right for you and act according to the Light you possess now in your life.  Because you may be called upon to undertake a radical departure from old ways, total honesty is required.  Otherwise, through negligence or refusal to see clearly, you may cause pain to others, damage to yourself.

Not rigidity but flow is proper attitude at this time.  And yet you must wait for the universe to act.  Drawing this Rune remember: we do without doing, and everything gets done.
