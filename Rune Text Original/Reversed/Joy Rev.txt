Things are slow in coming to fruition.  The process of birth is long and arduous, and fears arise fro the safety of the "child" within.  A crisis, a difficult passage- even if brief-is at hand.  Consideration and deliberation are called for, because light and shadow are still intermixed and doubts and scruples might interfere with joyousness if not understood as timely to your growth.  So stop your anxiety and ask yourself whether you possess the virtues of seriousness, sincerity and emptiness; to possess them is to have the tranquility that is the ground for clarity, patience and perseverance.

Seen in its true light, everything is a test.  And so, focused in the present, sincere toward others and trusting in your process, know that you cannot fail.
