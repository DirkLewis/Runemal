If you feel you are blocked, this Rune urges you to begin by being clear with yourself, facing up, admitting, releasing, whatever it takes.  Do not turn to others now, but look inside in silence, for the enemy of your progress.  No matter what area of your life seems to you to be blocked or thwarted, stop and reconsider: you will recognize the outer "enemy" as but a reflection of what you have not, before now, been willing or able to recognize as coming from within.

Above all do not give yourself airs.  The momentum of past habits is the challenge here: in the life of the Spirit you are always at the beginning.
