This Rune is akin to the moon, to the yin, the intuitive energy with its urge toward harmonizing and adjusting in the sphere of personal relationships.  It embodies the need to share, the yearning to be desired, a search after similarities.

The completion of beginnings is what Inguz requires.  It may mark a time of joyous deliverance, of new life, a new path.  A Rune of great power, it indicates that the force is available to achieve completion, resolution, from which comes a new beginning.  Above all, completion is crucial here.  It may be timely that you complete a project now; if so, make that your first priority.  Perhaps a difficult state of mind can be resolved, clarified, turned around.  The appearance of this Rune in a spread indicates that you must fertilize the ground for your own deliverance.

All things change, and we cannot live permanently amid obstructions.  With deliverance comes the release from tensions and uncertainty.  As you resolve and clear away the old, you will experience a release.

The period at or just prior to birth is often a dangerous one.  Now it is time to enter the delivery room.  Movement involves danger, and yet movement that is timely leads out of danger.  This Rune signals your emergence from a closed, chrysalis state.  Prior to "breaking out" you may be required to free yourself from some deep cultural pattern, some activity that was quite proper to the self you are leaving behind.

Another of the Cycle Runes, Inguz counsels preparation.  Being centered and grounded, your space cleared of all unwanted influences, and seeing the humor, you are indeed prepared to open to the Will of Heaven, and can await your deliverance with calm certainty.
