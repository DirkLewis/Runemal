Real property is associated with this Rune, for Othila is the Rune of acquisition and benefits.  It seems strange to say, but the benefits you receive, the "inheritance," may be derived from something you must give up.  This can be particularly difficult when that which you are called upon to give up or abandon is part of your background, you cultural inheritance.  For then you must look closely at what, until now, you have proudly claimed as your birthright.  Whether it is your attachment to your position in society, to the work you do or even to your beliefs about your own nature, the separation called for now will free you to become more truly who you are.

This is a time of separating paths.  Old skins must be shed, outmoded relationships discarded.  When this Rune appears in a spread, a peeling away is called for.  This is a Rune of radical severance.

The proper action here is submission and, quite probably, retreat.  Retreat in the sense of reserve in your conduct; of knowing how and when to retreat and possessing the firmness of will to carry it out.

Reversed:
The warning is that you take pains not to be mechanical or unaware.  This is not a time to be bound by old conditioning, old authority.  Ask yourself what feels right for you and act according to the Light you possess now in your life.  Because you may be called upon to undertake a radical departure from old ways, total honesty is required.  Otherwise, through negligence or refusal to see clearly, you may cause pain to others, damage to yourself.

Not rigidity but flow is proper attitude at this time.  And yet you must wait for the universe to act.  Drawing this Rune remember: we do without doing, and everything gets done.
