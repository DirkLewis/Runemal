This Rune is a fruit-bearing branch.  The term of travail is ended and you have "come to yourself" in some regard.  The shift that was due has occurred and now you can freely receive its blessings, whether they be in material gain, in your emotional life or in a heightened sense of your own well-being.  This is an alchemical moment in which understanding is transmuted from knowledge.  The knowledge itself was necessary but not sufficient condition; now you can rejoice, having been carried across the gap by the Tao, the Holy Spirit.

Joyousness accompanies new energy, energy blocked before now.  Light pierces the clouds and touches the waters just as something lovely emerges from the depths.  The soul is illuminated from within, at the meeting place of Heaven and Earth, the meeting of the waters.

There is a new clarity, which may call for you to renounce existing plans, ambitions, goals.  It is proper and timely that you submit, for Wunjo is a Rune of restoration, of the self properly aligned to the Self.

Reversed:
Things are slow in coming to fruition.  The process of birth is long and arduous, and fears arise fro the safety of the "child" within.  A crisis, a difficult passage- even if brief-is at hand.  Consideration and deliberation are called for, because light and shadow are still intermixed and doubts and scruples might interfere with joyousness if not understood as timely to your growth.  So stop your anxiety and ask yourself whether you possess the virtues of seriousness, sincerity and emptiness; to possess them is to have the tranquility that is the ground for clarity, patience and perseverance.

Seen in its true light, everything is a test.  And so, focused in the present, sincere toward others and trusting in your process, know that you cannot fail.

This Rune Reversed is useful meditation.
