This is the Rune of opening up, of renewed clarity, of dispelling the darkness that has been shrouding some part of your life.  You are free now to receive, and to know the joy of non-attached giving.

Kano is the Rune for the morning of activities, for seriousness, clarity and concentration, all of which are essential at the beginning of work.  The protection offered by this Rune is that the more light you have, the better you can see what is trivial and outmoded in your conditioning.

In relationships, there can now be a mutual opening up.  You may serve as the trigger, the timekeeper, through your awareness that the light of understanding is once again available to you both.

Recognize that, while on the one hand you are limited and dependent, on the other you exist at the perfect center where the harmonious and beneficent forces of the universe merge and radiate.  You are that center.

Reversed:
Expect a darkening of the light in some situation or relationship.  A friendship may be dying, a partnership, a marriage, some aspect of yourself, and old way of being that is no longer appropriate or valid.  Receiving this Rune puts you on notice that failure to face up to the death consciously would constitute a loss of opportunity.  Kano is one of the Cycle Runes.  Reversed, it points to the death of a way of life invalidated by growth.

Reversed, this Rune calls for giving up, gladly the old, and being prepared to live for a time empty; it calls for developing inner stability-not being seduced by the momentum of old ways while waiting for the new to become illuminated in its proper time.
