The Rune of movement, of physical shifts, new dwelling places, new attitudes, new life; movement also, in the sense of improving or bettering any situation.  Ehwaz is a Rune of transit and transition.

There is about this Rune a sense of gradual development and steady progress, with the accompanying notion of slow growth through numerous shifts and changes.  This could apply to the growth of a business or to a the development of an idea.  A relationship also needs to undergo changes and transformation if it is to maintain growth and life.

Let it be said this way: "As I cultivate my nature, all else follows."  A horse is the Rune symbol because it progresses gradually.  From Bronze age artifacts we find the sun linked to the horse; the horse both symbolized the sun and was regarded as drawing it across the sky.  Here, this Rune is saying, you have progressed far enough to feel a measure of safety, of surety in your position.  Now, it is time to turn again and face the future reassured and prepared to share the good fortune that comes.  This last, the sharing, is significant, as it relates to the power of the sun to foster life and illuminate all things in its light.
