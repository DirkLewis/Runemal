This a Rune of fulfillment: ambition satisfied, rewards received, love fulfilled.  It also promises nourishment, from the most worldly to the sacred and Divine.  For if the ancient principle "As above so below" is true, then we are also here to nourish God.  This is a Rune that calls for a deep probing of the meaning of profit and gain in your life.  Look with care to know weather it is wealth and possessions you require for your well-being, or rather self-rule and growth of a will.

Another concern of Fehu is with conserving what has already been gained.  It urges vigilance and continual mindfulness, especially in time of good fortune, for it is then that we are likely to collapse ourselves into our success on the one hand, or to behave recklessly on the other.  Enjoy you good fortune and remember to share it; the mark of a well nourished self the ability to nourish others.
