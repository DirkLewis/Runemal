This is the Rune of opening up, of renewed clarity, of dispelling the darkness that has been shrouding some part of your life.  You are free now to receive, and to know the joy of non-attached giving.

Kano is the Rune for the morning of activities, for seriousness, clarity and concentration, all of which are essential at the beginning of work.  The protection offered by this Rune is that the more light you have, the better you can see what is trivial and outmoded in your conditioning.

In relationships, there can now be a mutual opening up.  You may serve as the trigger, the timekeeper, through your awareness that the light of understanding is once again available to you both.

Recognize that, while on the one hand you are limited and dependent, on the other you exist at the perfect center where the harmonious and beneficent forces of the universe merge and radiate. You are that center.
