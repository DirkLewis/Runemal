This Rune is a fruit bearing branch.  The term of travail is ended and you have "come to yourself" in some regard.  The shift that was due has occurred and now you can freely receive its blessings, whether they be in material gain, in your emotional life or in a heightened sense of your own well-being.  This is an alchemical moment in which understanding is transmuted from knowledge.  The knowledge itself was necessary but not sufficient condition; now you can rejoice, having been carried across the gap by the Tao, the Holy Spirit.

Joyousness accompanies new energy, energy blocked before now.  Light pierces the clouds and touches the waters just as something lovely emerges from the depths.  The soul is illuminated from within, at the meeting place of Heaven and Earth, the meeting of the waters.

There is a new clarity, which may call for you to renounce existing plans, ambitions, goals.  It is proper and timely that you submit, for Wunjo is a Rune of restoration, of the self properly aligned to the Self.
