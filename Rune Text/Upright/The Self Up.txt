The starting point ins the self.  Its essence is water.  Only clarity, willingness to change, is effective now.  A correct relationship to your self is primary, for from it flow all possible correct relationships with others and with the Divine.

Remain modest, that is the Runemal's counsel.  Regardless of how great may be your merit, be yielding and devoted, moderate and correct, for then you have true direction for your way of life.

Be in the world but not if it.  That is implicit here.  And yet do not be closed, or narrow, or judging.  Remain receptive to impulses flowing from the Divine within and without.

This is a time of major growth and rectification; and as a rule rectification must come before progress.

This is not a time for trying to get "credit" for accomplishments, but rather seek to fulfill the time span, content to do your task for the task's sake.

If you take the Rune of the Self and cut it down the middle, you get the Rune for Joy with its mirror image.  There is a subtle caution here against carelessness.  The Self is required to balance the Self.

The first counsel was Know thyself.  With these words, the alphabet of the Runemal begins.
