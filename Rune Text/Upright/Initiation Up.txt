A hieratic or mystery Rune pointing to that which is beyond our frail manipulative powers.  This Rune is on the side of Heaven, the Unknowable, and has associations with the phoenix, that mystical bird that consumes itself in the fire and then rises from its own ashes.  Its ways are secret and hidden.

Deep inner transformational forces are at work here.  Yet what is achieved is not easily or readily shared.  An integrity is involved that my be masked, disguised or secret.  After all, becoming whole, the means of it, is a profound secret.

On the side of the earthly or mundane, there may well be surprises; unexpected gains are not unlikely.  On the side human nature, this Rune is symbolized by the flight of the eagle.  Soaring flight, free from entanglement, lifting yourself above the endless ebb and flow of ordinary life to acquire broader vision, all this is indicated here.  This is the Rune of question.

Another of the Cycle Runes, Perth signifies an intense aspect of initiation.  Nothing external matters here, except as it shows you its inner reflection.  this Rune is concerned with the deepest stratum of being, with the bedrock on which your fate is founded.  For some, Perth means experiencing a psychic death.  If need be, let go of everything, no exceptions, no exclusions.  Nothing less than renewal of the Spirit is at stake.
