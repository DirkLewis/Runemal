The winter of the spiritual life is upon you.  You may find yourself entangled in a situation to whose implications you are, in effect, blind.  You may be powerless to do anything except submit, surrender, even sacrifice some long cherished desire.  Be patient, for this is the fallow period that precedes a rebirth.

Positive accomplishment is unlikely now.  There is a freeze on useful activity, all your plans on hold.  You may be experiencing an unaccustomed drain on your energy and wonder why: the chill wind is reaching you over the ice floes of old outmoded habits.

Trying to hold on can result in shallowness of feeling, a sense of being out of touch with life, out of phase.  Seek to discover what it is you are holding onto that keeps this condition in effect, and let go.  Shed, release, cleanse away the old.  That will bring on the thaw.  Usually Isa requires a sacrifice of the personal, the "I".

And yet there is no reason for anxiety.  Submit and be still, for what your are experiencing is not necessarily the result of your actions, your habits, but of the conditions of the time, against which you can do nothing.  What has been full must empty; what has increased must decrease.  This is the way of Heaven and Earth.  To surrender is to display courage and wisdom.

At such a time, do not hope to rely on help or friendly support.  Exercise caution in your isolation, and do not stubbornly persist in attempting to work your will.  Remain mindful that the seed of the new is present in the shell of the old, the seed of unrealized potential, the seed of the good.  Your conduct now ill bring the new fruit to ripeness, or cause it to rot on the fine.  Trust your own process, and watch for signs of spring.
