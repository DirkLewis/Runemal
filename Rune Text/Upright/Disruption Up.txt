The urge for change, freedom, invention and liberation invest this Rune.  Drawing it indicates a pressing need within the psyche to break free from constricting identification with material reality and to experience the world of archetypal mind

Hagalaz is the Rune of elemental disruption, of events totally beyond your control.  Although it has only an Upright position, it always operates through reversal.  When you draw this Rune, expect disruption of your plans, for it is the great "Awakener," although the form the awakening takes may vary.  Perhaps you will experience a gradual feeling of coming to your senses, as though you were emerging from a long sleep.  Then again, the onset of power may be such as to rip away the fabric of what you previously know as your reality, your security, your understanding of yourself, your work, your relationships and beliefs.

Be aware, however, that what operates here is not ultimately an outside force, not a situation of you at the mercy of externals.  Your own nature is creating what's happening, and your are not without power in this situation.  The inner strength you have funded until now in your life is your support and guide at a time when everything you've taken for granted is being challenged.

Receiving this Rune puts you on notice: you may sustain loss or damage, a tree falls on your home, a relationship fails, plans go wrong, a source of supply dries up.  But you are forewarned and, therefore, encouraged to understand and accept what occurs as necessary, called for in your deeps out of a pressing need for growth.

There is nothing trivial about this Rune.  The more severe the disruption in your life, the more significant and timely the requirements for your growth.  The term "radical discontinuity" best describes the action of this, another of the Cycle Runes, at its most forceful: the universe and your own soul are demanding that you do, indeed, grow.
