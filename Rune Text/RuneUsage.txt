Runemal is the art of casting Rune stones and divining the meanings of each stone based on a particular location in a spread.  The Runes are a dowsing rod, with their help you can take timely action on events in your life or undertake the one activity that has no equal: self-change.

The Runes are an ancient Oracle.  Older than the New Testament, the Runes have lain fallow for more that 300 years.  Akin in function to the Tarot and the Chinese Book of Changes, the Runes were last in current use in Iceland during the late Middle Ages.  In there time they served as the I Ching of the Vikings.  Like all Oracles, the Runes are an instrument for tuning in to our own wisdom.

The term self is used to represent the little self or the ego-self, and Self to signify the Higher or Transpersonal Self.

Each of us is an Oracle, and when we pray to the Divine we are exercising our true oracular function, which is to consult the Knowing  Self within.

You will take a moment and clear your mind and commune with the Divine about an issue in your life.  A direct question is not the best approach.  Meditate on the "issue" you wish guidance and the answers will come.

Runemal is a real-time event, because whatever happens in the given moment possesses the quality peculiar to that moment.  It allows you to be in a particular moment with your self.

Rune casting is high adventure.  It means taking the wheel of your life and owning your power.  The new maps, unlike the old are three-dimensional, and the third dimension is Spirit.

Through Runemal we begin to make contact within our depths, we will begin to hear messages of profound beauty and true usefulness.

Traditionally you have three fields upon which to cast your Runes, a One, Three and Six Rune field.  The more Runes you cast the deeper the look into the Self you will peer.
