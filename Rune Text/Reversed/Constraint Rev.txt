When something within us is disowned, that which is disowned wreaks havoc.  A cleansing is required here; in undertaking it you fund a will and strengthen character.  Begin with what is most difficult and proceed to what is easy.  Remember that "suffering," in its original sense, merely meant "undergoing."  Thus you are required to undergo the dark side of your passage.  To control you anger, to restrain you instincts, to keep your faith firm, all this is at issue here.  Modesty and good temper are the essential blessings at such a time.
