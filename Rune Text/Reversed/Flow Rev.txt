A warning against overreach, excessive striving; a counsel against trying to exceed your own strength or operate beyond the power you have funded to date in your life.

This Rune Reversed often indicates a failure to draw upon the wisdom of instinct.  As a result the intuitive side of your nature may be languishing, leaving you permanently out of balance.  What is called for now is to go within, to honor the receptive side of your Warrior Nature.
