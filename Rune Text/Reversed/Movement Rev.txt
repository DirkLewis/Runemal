Movement that appears to block.  This Rune reversed puts you on notice that an opportunity is at hand and should not be ignored.  Be certain that what you are doing or not doing is timely.  There are no missed opportunities; we have simply to recognize that all opportunities are not for us, all possibilities are not open to us.  If you are feeling at a loss, unclear about the need to act, consider what is timely and appropriate to your nature: the opportunity at hand may be precisely to avoid action.  Remember that what is yours will come to you.
