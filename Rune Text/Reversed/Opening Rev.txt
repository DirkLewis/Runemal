Expect a darkening of the light in some situation or relationship.  A friendship may be dying, a partnership, a marriage, some aspect of yourself, and old way of being that is no longer appropriate or valid.  Receiving this Rune puts you on notice that failure to face up to the death consciously would constitute a loss of opportunity.  Kano is one of the Cycle Runes.  Reversed, it points to the death of a way of life invalidated by growth.

Reversed, this Rune calls for giving up, gladly the old, and being prepared to live for a time empty; it calls for developing inner stability not being seduced by the momentum of old ways while waiting for the new to become illuminated in its proper time.
