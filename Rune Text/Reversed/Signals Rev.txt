You may well be concerned over what appears to be failed communication, lack of clarity or awareness either in your past history or in a present situation.    Equally, you may feel concern because of difficulties that inhibit your from accepting what is offered.  Then again a sense of futility, of wasted motion, of a fruitless journey may dismay you.  Remember, however, that this is one of the Cycle Runes.  What is happening is timely in your process.  If the well is clogged, this is the moment for cleaning out the old.  Reversed this Rune is saying "Consider the uses of adversity."
