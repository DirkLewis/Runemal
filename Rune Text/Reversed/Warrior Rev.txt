The danger is that through hasty or ill-timed action energy leaks out, is spilled away.  If an association is short lived, do not grieve, but know that it has fulfilled its span.  Matters of trust and confidence are at issue here, and with them the authenticity of your way of being in the world.

There is a risk of collapsing into your emotions of behaving recklessly.  This is a Rune of powerful energy.  Reversed, it calls for having a serious think with yourself.  Examine your motives.  Are you trying to dominate another?  Are you focused on outcomes rather than on the activity for its own sake?

This is not a matter on which to seek outside advice.  Keep your own counsel.  Through consulting the Runes, you are consulting the Self, which is the action  proper to a Spiritual Warrior.
