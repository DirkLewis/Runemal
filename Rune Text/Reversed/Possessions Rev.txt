There may be considerable frustration in your life if you draw this Rune Reversed, a wide range of dispossessions reaching from the trivial to the severe: you fall short in your efforts, you reach out and miss, you get on the wrong train.  You have to sit helplessly by and watch while what you've gained starts to dwindle away.  Observe what is happening.  Examine the negativity from an open perspective and ask, "What lesson do I need to learn from this in my life?"

Even if there is occasion for joy, do not be deduced into mindless joyousness.  Reversed, Fehu indicates that doubtful situations are abundant and come in many forms and guises.  You are being put in touch with the shadow side of possessions.  Yet all this is part of the coming to be and passing away, and is not that which abides.  In dealing with the shadow side, you have an opportunity to recognize where your true nourishment lies.
