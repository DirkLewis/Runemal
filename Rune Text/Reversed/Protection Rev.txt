Look carefully at the associations you form at this time.  Be thoughtful about your health and alert not to add weight to the burdens others are carrying.  If you see fit to become involved with people who are "using" you stay conscious of that fact and take responsibility for your own position; then you can only benefit.  And yet regardless of whether your enterprise prospers or suffers, do not be concerned: you may not win, but you will never lose, for you will always learn from what takes place.  Temperance and courtesy are the sinews of this Rune's protective powers.
