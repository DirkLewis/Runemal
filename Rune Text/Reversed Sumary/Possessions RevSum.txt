There may be considerable frustration in your life if you draw this Rune Reversed, a wide range of dispossessions reaching from the trivial to the severe: you fall short in your efforts, you reach out and miss, you get on the wrong train.  You have to sit helplessly by and watch while what you've gained starts to dwindle away.  Observe what is happening.
