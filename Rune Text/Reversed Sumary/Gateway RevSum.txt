Hasty decisions at this time may cause regrets, for the probability is that you will act from weakness, deceive yourself about your motives and create new problems more severe than those you are attempting to resolve.  Impulses must be tempered by thought for correct procedure.  Keep still and collect yourself, wait on the Tao, the Will of Heaven, nothing else is timely now.
