As we are tested, we fund the power to avert blockage and defeat.  At the same time, we develop in ourselves an aversion to the conduct that brings us into stressful situations.

There appears to be blockage in your path, but even a delay may prove beneficial.  Do not be overly eager to press forward.  This is not a time or situation in which you can make your influence felt.  Patience is the counsel Eihwaz offers.  Nothing hectic, no acting needy or lusting after a desired outcome.  This Rune speaks to the difficulties that arise at the beginning of new life.  Often it announces a time of waiting: for a spring to fill up with water, for fruit to ripen on the bough.

Perseverance and foresight are called for here.  The ability to foresee consequences before you act is the mark of  the profound person.  Avert anticipated difficulties through right action.  We are not doers, but we are deciders.  Once our decision is clear, the doing becomes effortless, for then the universe supports and empowers our action.

Receiving the Rune Eihwaz you are put on notice that through inconvenience and discomfort, growth is promoted.  This may well be a trying time; certainly it is a meaningful one.  Set your house in order, tend to business, be clear and wait on the Tao, the Will of Heaven.
