Drawing this Rune is an indication that union, uniting or partnership is some form is at hand.  But you are put on notice not to collapse yourself into that union.  For true partnership can only be achieved by separate and whole beings who retain their separateness even in unity and uniting.  Remember to let the winds of Heaven dance between you.

At all levels, in love relationships, in business matters, in partnering of every kind, this counsel applies particularly when you enter into partnership with the Higher Self.  Establishing and open, flowing channel between the self and the Self is the ultimate form of human partnership.  For out of it comes union with the Divine; God always enters into equal partnerships.

Thus Gebo, the Rune of Partnership, has no reverse for it signifies the gift of freedom from which flows all other gifts.
