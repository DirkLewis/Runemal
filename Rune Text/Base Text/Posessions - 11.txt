This a Rune of fulfillment: ambition satisfied, rewards received, love fulfilled.  It also promises nourishment, from the most worldly to the sacred and Divine.  For if the ancient principle "As above so below" is true, then we are also here to nourish God.  This is a Rune that calls for a deep probing of the meaning of profit and gain in your life.  Look with care to know weather it is wealth and possessions you require for your well-being, or rather self-rule and growth of a will.

Another concern of Fehu is with conserving what has already been gained.  It urges vigilance and continual mindfulness, especially in time of good fortune, for it is then that we are likely to collapse ourselves into our success on the one hand, or to behave recklessly on the other.  Enjoy you good fortune and remember to share it; the mark of a well-nourished self the ability to nourish others.

Reversed:
There may be considerable frustration in your life if you draw this Rune Reversed, a wide range of dispossessions reaching from the trivial to the severe: you fall short in your efforts, you reach out and miss, you get on the wrong train.  You have to sit helplessly by and watch while what you've gained starts to dwindle away.  Observe what is happening.  Examine the negativity from an open perspective and ask, "What lesson do I need to learn from this in my life?"

Even if there is occasion for joy, do not be deduced into mindless joyousness.  Reversed, Fehu indicates that doubtful situations are abundant and come in many forms and guises.  You are being put in touch with the shadow side of possessions.  Yet all this is part of the coming to be and passing away, and is not that which abides.  In dealing with the shadow side, you have an opportunity to recognize where your true nourishment lies.
