This the first of the twelve Runes that make up the Cycle of Self-Transformation, Runes that focus directly upon the mechanism of self-change.  The keynote here is receiving: messages, signals, gifts.  Even a timely warning may be seen as a gift.  When the Messenger Rune brings sacred knowledge, to one is truly blessed.

The message may be that of a new life unfolding.  New lives begin with new connections, surprising linkages that direct us into new pathways.  Take pains to be especially aware and conscience during meetings, visits, chance encounters, particularly with persons wiser than yourself.  A sense of new family solidarity invests Ansuz.

Through association with the Norse god Loki, Mercury overshadows this Rune.  In mythology a strange, androgynous figure, keeper of the keys to knowledge, Mercury carried messages between the gods and between gods and humanity.  In him is symbolized the urge to integrate unconscious motive with conscious recognition.  Drawing this Rune tells you: connection with the Divine is at hand.

This Rune is a signal to explore the depths, the foundations of life, and to experience the inexhaustible wellspring of the Divine in your nature.  You are reminded that you must draw first from the well to nourish and give to yourself.  Then there will be more than enough to nourish others.

Reversed:
You may well be concerned over what appears to be failed communication, lack of clarity or awareness either in your past history or in a present situation.  Equally, you may feel concern because of difficulties that inhibit your from accepting what is offered.  Then again a sense of futility, of wasted motion, of a fruitless journey may dismay you.  Remember, however, that this is one of the Cycle Runes.  What is happening is timely in your process.  If the well is clogged, this is the moment for cleaning out the old.  Reversed this Rune is saying "Consider the uses of adversity."
