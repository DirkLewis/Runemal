This the Rune of the Spiritual Warrior.  Always the battle of the Spiritual Warrior is with the self.  Embodied in this Rune is the energy of discrimination, the swordlike quality that enables us to cut away the old, the dead, the extraneous.  With this Rune comes the certain knowledge that the universe always has the first move.
