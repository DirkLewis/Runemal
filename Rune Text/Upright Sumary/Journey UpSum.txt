Raido is another of the Runes in the Cycle of Self-Transformation.  Inner worth mounts here, and at such a time we must remember that we are not intended to rely entirely upon our own power, but instead to ask what is right action.  Ask through prayer, through addressing your own knowing, your body knowing, the Witness Self, the Teacher Within.
