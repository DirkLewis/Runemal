This a Rune of fulfillment: ambition satisfied, rewards received, love fulfilled.  It also promises nourishment, from the most worldly to the sacred and Divine.  For if the ancient principle "As above so below" is true, then we are also here to nourish God.  This is a Rune that calls for a deep probing of the meaning of profit and gain in your life.
