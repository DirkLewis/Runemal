Thurisaz is a Rune of non-action.  The gateway is not to be approached and passed through without contemplation.  Here you are being confronted with a true reflection of what is hidden in yourself, what must be exposed and examined before successful action can be undertaken.  This Rune's strength lies in its ability to wait.
